Implementation Plan: Python Sets Interactive Module
Goal Description
Create a single-file interactive HTML learning module for Python Sets (set), strictly adhering to the specified learning outcomes (Bloom's Taxonomy) and visual/didactic requirements.

File Location
Unidad3/Modulo1-pyplot/modulo1-pyplot.html

Visual & Tech Specs (Strict)
Structure: Single HTML5 file.
Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
Scripting: Vanilla JavaScript (via CDN if needed, but likely inline/local).
Window Style: macOS style window controls (Red/Yellow/Green dots), Rounded tabs.
Code Style: VS Code Light+ theme.
Color Palette (Mandatory):
#ffffff (Base Background)
#f1f5f9 (Alt Background)
#003c58 (Main Titles)
#06717e (Visual Accents)
#0055ad (Buttons/Actions)
#399be2 (Hover)
#0f6cbf (Highlighted Containers)
#6ea2ee (Text on Dark)
#6da8e9 (Descriptive Text)
#1e293b (Long Text)
#e2e8f0 (Borders)
Detailed Slide Breakdown
Slide 1: Portada (Activación)
Header: "Sets (Conjuntos) en Python" | Subtitle: "Fundamentos y operaciones".
Content: Brief intro on What (Collections without order/duplicates) and Why (Efficiency, math operations).
Design: Clean, uncluttered.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student is cognitively primed and understands the high-level utility (efficiency/math).
Slide 2: ¿Qué es un set? (Comprender - RA1)
Concept: Definition (Unique, Unordered, Mutable).
Comparision: Vs Lists (Conceptual).
Didactic Element (Mandatory):
Analogy: Represent sets as a bag of unique items vs a shelf (list).
Guided Question: "Why wouldn't a list work effectively here?" regarding uniqueness.
Interaction: Read-only code examples.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student can correct explain why sets remove duplicates without referencing syntax.
Slide 3: Operaciones Básicas (Aplicar - RA2)
Interactive Console: macOS-styled terminal.
Interaction Flow (Strict):
Predict: "What do you think will happen if we add '2' again?"
Action: User clicks "Run Code".
Result: Terminal shows {1, 2, 3} (no duplicate).
Explanation: Brief tooltip/text explaining the result.
Operations: my_set = {1, 2, 3}, add(), remove(), in.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student moves from mechanical clicking to conscious prediction of set behavior (mutability/uniqueness).
Slide 4: Operaciones entre Sets (Analizar - RA3)
Visuals: Interactive Venn Diagrams (SVG or CSS shapes).
Operations: Union |, Intersection &, Difference -, Symmetric Diff ^.
Common Mistake (Mandatory):
Explicitly show that A - B is NOT equal to B - A.
"Many students assume difference is symmetric. Look at this counterexample."
Didactic Element: Compare results explicitly.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student can identify non-commutative operations (difference) and visually map syntax to logic.
Slide 5: Contexto Real (Evaluar - RA4)
Scenario: "Physical Store Clients" vs "Online Clients".
Flow:
Present Problem text.
Mandatory Question: "Which operation would you use to find clients who bought in BOTH?" (Intersection).
User selects answer.
Show Code Solution with justification.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student selects the correct set operation based on a natural language problem description.
Slide 6: Cierre (Metacognición)
Summary: Key concepts recap.
Checklist: "Now you can...".
Advice: "When to use Sets" vs "When NOT to use them".
Next Steps: Preparing for the next module.
Cognitive Check (Internal): Student can articulate a valid use-case for sets vs lists.
Verification Checklist
 Verify all colors match the hex codes exactly.
 Ensure "Auto-correction" behavior is active (I will self-correct if the generated code is buggy).
 Check that no external assets (images/css files) are referenced locally; use embedded SVG/Data URIs or CDNs.
